## Actions

### Edit Group

Edit basic group details. Supported actions:

- Add user to group
- Remove user from group
- Add owner to group
- Remove owner from group
- Allow external senders (Distribution and Microsoft 365 groups)

## Known Issues / Limitations

Groups currently don't return all data such as external senders, and not all settings are available to set using the Graph API by partners. Microsoft is aware and planning to fix this in a future release of the Graph API.
Distribution groups currently cannot be edited due to a limit in the Graph API.
